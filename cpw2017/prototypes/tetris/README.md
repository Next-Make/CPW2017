# Tetris

There are two versions of the game in the folder, which have
the same rules and functionality but differ in terms of orientation.
In `portrait.py`, the screen is 7 * 5 (7 rows and 5 columns), with
pieces moving from top to bottom. In `landscape.py`, the screen is
5 * 7, with pieces moving from left to right.
