# Game Prototyping

Prototyping in Python is a great and easy way to get started with games.
To get started, all you need to install is **pygame** and then you can run
the example code as follows:
```
python example.py
```

To run your own game (we'll call it `your_game.py`), you can run it as follows:
```
python your_game.py
```

The example code provides a lot of useful functions for prototyping your own
games. There are also great **pygame** tutorials for additional inspiration in
case the example code is missing something that you want to implement. Even
better, if you think a function you wrote could be of use for others, feel
free to add it to `example.py`!
