# Designing Games

The CPW board games must all be written in C, but designing games in C
can be annoying when it comes to debugging an errors in your code. It
can be easier to design your games in an environment where debugging is
easy and mistakes can be more easily forgiven.

This is where **Python** and **pygame** come into play. **Python** is a nice high-level
language that is more forgiving with errors, and **pygame** is a great environment
where you can design your games before grappling with the implementation
details of C. If you are not comfortable with C, it is highly recommended that
you prototype your games in Python first, since that will be easier to learn.

Although prototyping in Python is the recommended way to go, we have nevertheless
provided example code in both C and Python so that you have flexibility, especially
if C is actually your language of choice. If you finish designing a game in Python
but are not comfortable converting it to C, we will be more than happy to assist.

Happy gaming!
